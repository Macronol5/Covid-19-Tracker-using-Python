# Covid-19-Tracker-using-Python

Today we are going to make Covid-19 Tracker Application Using Python which you can assume to be a medium level project as we will need to use three Python libraries.

Here, we are going to create a GUI application to track the COVID-19 cases.

We need to use three different libraries here.

tkinter – for GUI
matplotlib – to show data graphically
covid – to get COVID data
We have many posts based on tkinter so if you have any problem in tkinter then we suggest to read them.

You can install “matplotlib” using the pip command given below

"pip install matplotlib"

Python community has made a library to get the COVID-19 information easily.

Library is"covid" and its so simple to use.

Visit this site for more details of this library.

You can download it using the pip command given below.

"pip install covid"

Note: python >= 3.6

Type this command in your terminal to install and use this library.

Now lets see and understand the code.
